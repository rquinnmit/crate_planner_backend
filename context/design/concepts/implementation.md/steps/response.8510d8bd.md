# response:

Of course. Here is a comprehensive test suite for the `CratePlanner` class implemented in `src/core/crate/_planner.ts`.

This test suite uses Deno's built-in testing framework and its standard library for mocking and assertions. It focuses on isolating the `CratePlanner` from its external dependencies (like MongoDB and LLM APIs) to ensure the tests are fast, reliable, and test the planner's logic specifically.

### Test Setup and Strategy

1. **Dependencies Mocked**:
   * **MongoDB (`Db`, `Collection`)**: A mock `Collection` is created to simulate database interactions with an in-memory array of `Track` objects.
   * **LLM (`GeminiLLM`)**: A mock class is created to simulate `executeLLM` calls, allowing us to control the "AI's" responses for different scenarios (valid, invalid, etc.).
   * **Spotify Search (`SpotifySearchService`)**: A mock class is created to simulate Spotify API calls and provide a controlled set of candidate tracks.

2. **Test Structure**:
   * A main `describe` block for `CratePlanner`.
   * Nested `describe` blocks to group tests for different functionalities (e.g., Deterministic Planning, LLM-Powered Planning, Plan Management).
   * A `beforeEach` hook to ensure each test runs with a fresh, clean instance of the planner and its mocks.

3. **Assertions**:
   * Uses functions from `jsr:@std/assert` for clear, readable checks (`assertEquals`, `assertExists`, `assertThrows`, etc.).
   * Uses spies from `jsr:@std/testing/mock` to verify that methods like `console.error` and mock LLM/API calls are triggered when expected.
