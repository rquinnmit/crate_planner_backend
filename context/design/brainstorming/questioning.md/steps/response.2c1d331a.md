# response:

Of course. Let's refine the previous prompts by making them more specific, constrained, and directive. This reduces the LLM's ambiguity and forces it to produce higher-quality, more predictable results.

The key to making prompts more specific is to provide:

* **A Persona:** "Act as a senior developer..."
* **A Format:** "Provide the output as a JSON object..."
* **Constraints:** "Do not use any external libraries."
* **A Concrete Example:** "For instance, an item that is too heavy but not too large."
* **A Process:** "First, outline the steps. Second, write the code."

Here are the revised, more specific prompts, building on the same foundational context.

***

### Foundational Step: The Enhanced Context-Setting Prompt

This version is slightly improved by asking the LLM to confirm its understanding, ensuring the context is properly loaded.

**Master Prompt Template v2:**

```
You are an expert TypeScript developer specializing in logistics and combinatorial optimization algorithms. Your goals are to write clean, performant, and robust code that adheres to the provided specification.

I am providing you with the content of a Jest specification file, `CratePlanner.spec.ts`. This file is the single source of truth for the behavior of a `CratePlanner` class. All code, documentation, and analysis you generate must strictly adhere to the tests and interfaces defined within it.

Here is the content of `CratePlanner.spec.ts`:

```

// \[ PASTE THE ENTIRE CONTENT OF YOUR CratePlanner.spec FILE HERE ]

```

Please confirm that you have read and understood the spec file. Then, await my next instruction.
```

*(Wait for the LLM's confirmation before proceeding with the tasks below.)*

***

### Category 1: Code Generation & Implementation (More Specific)

**Prompt 1.1: Constrained Class Implementation**

> Based on the spec, write the complete implementation for the `CratePlanner` class in TypeScript.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * Implement a **First-Fit Decreasing (FFD)**-like algorithm. Specifically, iterate through the existing crates and place the item in the *first* crate where it fits. If it fits nowhere, create a new crate.
> * The solution must be self-contained. **Do not use any external libraries** for the packing logic.
> * Ensure all class properties are `private` and only expose the public methods defined by the tests.
> * When an item cannot fit in any crate due to its dimensions or weight exceeding the crate's capacity, throw a specific `Error` with a message like "Item \[item name/ID] is too large or heavy for any crate."
> * Add TSDoc comments explaining the FFD logic and the time complexity of the `addItem` method.

**Why it's better:** It prescribes a specific algorithm (FFD), sets constraints (no libraries, private properties), and defines a precise error-handling mechanism, leading to a more predictable and robust implementation.

**Prompt 1.2: Precise Method Implementation with State Management**

> Write **only** the `getPlan()` method for the `CratePlanner` class.
>
> **Requirements:**
>
> * The method should return a `Plan` object with a structure `{ crates: Crate[], unplacedItems: Item[] }`.
> * Crucially, the returned object must be a **deep copy** of the planner's internal state. Modifying the returned plan should not affect the internal state of the `CratePlanner` instance.
> * Include the TSDoc block for the method, specifying what it `@returns` and noting the deep copy behavior.

**Why it's better:** It focuses on a single method and introduces a critical software engineering concept (immutability/defensive copying), forcing the LLM to produce higher-quality, safer code.

***

### Category 2: Test Case Expansion (More Specific)

**Prompt 2.1: Persona-Driven Edge Case Generation**

> Act as a skeptical QA engineer trying to break the `CratePlanner` logic. Analyze the provided spec and generate exactly 5 new `it(...)` test blocks that target combinations of constraints the original tests might miss.
>
> **Focus specifically on:**
>
> 1. An item that fits the dimensions but exceeds the `maxWeight` of a partially filled crate.
> 2. An item that is extremely heavy but has almost zero volume.
> 3. A sequence of adding items and then adding one giant item that forces a new crate to be created, even if there's total volume available across older crates.
> 4. The case where the initial list of crates is empty.
> 5. Adding an item with a negative or zero dimension/weight (this should likely throw an error, so write a test that expects an error).
>
> **Format:** Provide only the raw `it(...)` blocks, ready to be pasted inside the `describe` block.

**Why it's better:** The persona ("skeptical QA engineer") and the highly specific scenarios guide the LLM to think adversarially, producing much more valuable and non-obvious test cases than a generic request.

**Prompt 2.2: Structured Test Data Generation**

> Generate a JSON object for a complex test scenario. The root object should have two keys: `crates` and `items`.
>
> **Data Constraints:**
>
> * `crates`: An array of exactly 2 `Crate` objects. One should be tall and narrow (e.g., `width: 10, depth: 10, height: 100`), the other wide and short (e.g., `width: 100, depth: 100, height: 10`). Both should have a `maxWeight` of `50`.
> * `items`: An array of 15 `Item` objects. This array must include:
>   * At least 5 "easy-to-fit" small items.
>   * 3 "tall" items that will only fit in the first crate.
>   * 3 "wide" items that will only fit in the second crate.
>   * 1 item that is dimensionally small but has a `weight` of `60` (should be unplaceable).
>   * 1 item that has dimensions `width: 101, depth: 101, height: 1` (should be unplaceable).
>   * The remaining items can be of moderate, awkward dimensions.
>
> **Output:** Provide only the JSON object, with no surrounding text.

**Why it's better:** This provides concrete, numeric constraints for the data, ensuring the generated test set is complex, diverse, and guaranteed to test the specific logical branches you care about.

***

### Category 3: Documentation & Explanation (More Specific)

**Prompt 3.1: High-Quality, Actionable README**

> Write a `README.md` file for the `CratePlanner` module.
>
> **Structure and Content:**
>
> * **`# CratePlanner`**: Top-level heading.
> * **`## Overview`**: Explain its purpose in one paragraph. Mention it solves a 3D Bin Packing Problem.
> * **`## Features`**: A bulleted list including "Handles 3D dimensions and weight constraints," "Supports multiple crates," and "Identifies unplaceable items."
> * **`## API Reference`**: Detail the class constructor and its public methods (`addItem`, `getPlan`). For each, use a markdown table to describe its parameters and return value.
> * **`## Usage Example`**: Provide a complete, copy-pasteable TypeScript code block that:
>   1. Imports `CratePlanner`.
>   2. Defines an array of initial `Crate` objects.
>   3. Instantiates `CratePlanner` with the crates.
>   4. Defines an array of `Item` objects to be added.
>   5. Loops through the items and calls `addItem` inside a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors.
>   6. Calls `getPlan()` and logs the final result to the console, showing both the placed and unplaced items.
> * **`## Limitations`**: Add a section explaining that the current implementation uses a simple heuristic (First-Fit) and does not guarantee the most optimal, space-saving solution.

**Why it's better:** This prompt dictates the exact structure and content of the README, including a fully-formed, practical usage example with error handling, which is far more valuable to a developer than a simple API list.

***

### Category 4: Code Review & Refactoring (More Specific)

**Prompt 4.1: Structured Code Review with Severity**

> I am providing my implementation of the `CratePlanner` class. Act as a principal software engineer performing a formal code review.
>
> **Your Task:**
> Analyze the code for correctness, performance, and style, comparing it against the provided spec. Present your feedback in a markdown table with the following columns:
>
> * `Severity`: (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`)
> * `File & Line Number`: (e.g., `CratePlanner.ts:42`)
> * `Issue Description`: A concise explanation of the problem.
> * `Suggested Improvement`: A concrete code snippet or clear instruction for fixing the issue.
>
> **Focus on:**
>
> * `High`: Logical bugs that would cause a test to fail or produce incorrect results.
> * `Medium`: Performance issues (e.g., unnecessary loops) or poor practice (e.g., mutating input).
> * `Low`: Style nits, typos, or opportunities for slightly cleaner code.
>
> **\[Paste your implementation here]**

**Why it's better:** The structured table format and severity levels transform the LLM's output from a simple text blob into an actionable, professional code review document that is easy to parse and prioritize.

**Prompt 4.2: Targeted Refactoring Proposal**

> Here is my current implementation of the `CratePlanner`. It works, but the placement logic inside `addItem` is becoming complex.
>
> **Your Task:**
> Propose a refactoring to extract the placement logic into a separate "Strategy" pattern.
>
> 1. Define a TypeScript `interface` named `PlacementStrategy` with a single method: `findPosition(item: Item, crates: Crate[]): { crateIndex: number } | null`.
> 2. Create a concrete implementation of this interface called `FirstFitStrategy`.
> 3. Show the `before` and `after` versions of the `CratePlanner` class, where the `after` version accepts a `PlacementStrategy` in its constructor and uses it in the `addItem` method.
> 4. Provide a MermaidJS class diagram illustrating the new relationship between `CratePlanner`, `PlacementStrategy`, and `FirstFitStrategy`.

**Why it's better:** Instead of a generic "suggest a refactor," this prompt directs the LLM to implement a specific, well-known design pattern (Strategy). This tests its ability to work with higher-level architectural concepts and provides a much more valuable and educational output.
